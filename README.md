"Projet Radin"
========================

This is the repo "Projet Radin" - the project of EPFL's Software Engineering 2014 course.


Conventions
========================
Use commit messages:
"Create xxx" or "Fix xxx"

Don't use: 
"Created xxx" or "Fixed xxx"
"Creates xxx" or "Fixes xxx"

Use a branch for each issue, and then merge to master only when you're sure it works and didn't break any previous code.
